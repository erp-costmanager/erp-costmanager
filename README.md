## Overview

Purchase Manager is an app for organizing a company's day-to-day purchase needs in one easy-to-use interface with an embedded authorization workflow.

The idea behind the app is to solve the issue many companies have where they leave the management of day-to-day purchase needs to spreadsheets, e-mails, and regular office communication.

This often results in miscommunication that can lead to late payments, or even worse, double payments.

Therefore, we want to provide a service to easily and efficiently manage your company's purchases.

2. **Add purchases:** Employees can add purchase requests and follow the review process. No matter the outcome of the review, the request is saved for future reference.

3. **Review requests**: Managers can approve or deny the purchase requests.

## Documentation

### Getting started

The first step required in order to use the app is to create a new company. Do this by clicking the "Set up your company account" button, and filling out the required fields on the next page.

The first user created will have the role of admin by default. The admin has the permission to approve or disapprove new users who sign up to the company account, as well as removing users completely, and changing the department of users. However, the admin is not able to access the purchase portal to make new purchase requests or review pending requests.

### Signing up new users

Once you've set up your company, you're ready to have more users sign up.

They do this by clicking the "Sign up a user account" button, and filling out the required fields on the next page.

When a new user signs up, they will initially have a status of "Pending". The administrator will need to approve the user in the admin portal before they gain access to the full app functionality.

While approving the user, the admin can also set the role of the user to either "Employee", "Manager", or "Admin", as well as assign the user to one of the pre-defined departments.

The admin can change the role and department of the user at any time.

### Adding purchase requests

If a user has either the role of "Employee" or "Manager", they are able to make purchase requests.

The user makes a purchase request by going to the purchase portal page and clicking the "Add new purchase request" button. This opens a form where the user has to enter the item they're requesting to purchase, as well as the cost of the item, and a reason for the request.

Once a purchase request has been made, it has a "Pending" status while awaiting review by a manager. In this state, the user can make edits to the request by clicking on the item in the "Purchase requests" list, and then clicking the "Edit" button. They can also delete the request by clicking the "Delete" button that also appears when clicking the item.

### Reviewing purchase requests

If a user has the role of "Manager" they are able to review pending purchase requests, and either approve or disapprove them.

They do this by clicking on the pending purchase request item in the "Purchase requests" list, and clicking either the "Approve" or "Disapprove" button. Before they do this, the manager can also add a comment to explain their reason for approving or disapproving the request.

### Editing the user profile

Each user role (Admin, Manager, and Employee) has access to their profile page. Here, they can edit their name, email, password and also upload a profile picture.
